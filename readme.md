# USFM Tools

## About

This is a respository of useful tools for working with USFM.

The tools are written in Python 3.

So far there is:

* *check* - a linter to check for common errors in USFM coding
* *tranform* - a system to render USFM to a number of other formats such as PDF, markdown and docx.
* *variant* - a lightweight micro-tool to maintain multiple variants of a text within a single USFM film

These can be accessed through the `usfm-tool` command.

The tools are under the MIT licence.

Documentation is currently, um, somwhat limited... (sorry)

## Status

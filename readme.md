# USFM Tools

## About

This is a respository of useful tools for working with USFM.

The tools are written in Python 3.

So far there is:

* *check* - a linter to check for common errors in USFM coding
* *tranform* - a system to render USFM to a number of other formats such as PDF, markdown and docx.

The tools are under the MIT licence.

Documentation is currently, um, somwhat limited... (sorry)

## Status

* **2017-11-08** - First pass updating to python3, some things are temporarily broken.
